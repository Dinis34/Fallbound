# LDTS t06g03 - Fallbound

**Fallbound** is a 2D platformer game where the player must fall down a series of platforms and gain power while defeating 
enemies. How far can you fall?

## THE IDEA

We wanted a game that was simple and fun to play. We decided to create a 2D platformer game where the player falls through a series of platforms while shooting down enemies. For this, the player movement must be refined to feel smooth and responsive. In our game, the main score would be the time, and the objective would be to survive as long as possible. 

## CONTROLS

### GAMEPLAY
- `Left Arrow` - move left.
- `Right Arrow` - move right.
- `Space` - jump.
- `Escape` - open pause menu.

### MENUS
- `Up Arrow` - select previous option.
- `Down Arrow` - select next option.
- `Enter` - confirm selection.

## IMPLEMENTED FEATURES
